# How To Help People With Autism in the Workplace
## Introduction
Hi, my name is Ivan. My goal, as the title suggests, is to help you to help people with autism in the workplace. I myself have autism. I am currently 31 years old and was only diagnosed with autism a couple of years back. I have been working for 7 years in the web development industry as a web developer. I’ve noticed in the last couple of years that the jobs I get don’t seem to be working out as well as I’d like. Now there's 2 sides to that - 1. It could partly be me 2. And it could also partly be the employers that are hiring me. There seems to often be cultural fit misalignment issues and jobs not working out. These issues are what motivated me to write this article. I have done a lot of planning for this article so I hope this delivery does that planning justice so let’s begin.
## Core Concept
### Conflict Can Manifest 
There are many different ways autism can manifest for people with autism and I speak from the experience of how it manifests for me. It seems to manifest for me as conflict. The conflict might further be a result of me having strong opinions and passion for things and those opinions and passions feeling to others like a waste of time or opinions they disagree with or both. I believe this opinionatedness is in fact a manifestation of my autism. I have noticed similar symptoms of confrontational opinionatedness in others like me too. People who either are either self-diagnosed with autism or those I would personally prescribe them as having autism. I noticed these people as also having their autism manifest in the troublesome way it seems to be manifesting for me.

### Three Brain Centers
I have done a lot of reflecting on how this can be managed in the context of work and have come up with a somewhat deep model to help explain the dynamic. I want to start this explanation by first talking about three brain centers. I will then tie it back to autism after that. We’ve got what I call our
- Work brain center
- Love brain center and
- Passion brain center
Now I want to flesh those out a bit more before tying them back to autism. So I say we have the above brain centers based on various avenues of research I have done but let’s just go with it for now. I will go into more depth on my research in a later section of this essay which I call Design Notes so feel free to check that section out for anyone interested. But for now let me give a bit of a description for each brain center.

### The Work Brain Center
The work brain center is our executive drive. It relates to our cerebral cortex and is the part of our brain that is unique to humans. It’s what makes us so accomplished as a species. It's the part of our brain that takes the reins over the rest of our brain and says “Okay brain you listen to me”, “You’re going to concentrate on the things I tell you to concentrate on and in doing so we are going to get more accomplished than you could ever do without me” and the rest of the brain follows suit.
### The Love Brain Center
The love brain center is a more mammalian kind of brain. It connects to our limbic system. The part of our brain unique to mammals and since humans are mammals we have it too. This is the compassionate part of our brain which helps us to build social connection and foster positive interactions with other members of our communities. It allows us to see value in others and see the value in cooperating with others. It drives us to nurture relationships and connections. 

### The Passion Brain Center
The passion brain has to do with our emotions and also has to do with not just our fight-and-flight systems, but also our seeking and navigation system i.e our feelings. It’s our emotional brain unique not just to mammals but to reptiles too whom mammals evolved from. Our emotional brains are what help us navigate our lives and get our needs met. 

### Primitive vs Executive
As much as I’d love to link this back to autism I have to further build on this model before I do so please bear with me. So if we look at the above three brain centers we could argue that our love and passion brain centers are somewhat more primitive since our executive brain is what makes us uniquely human. Love and passion is shared with many other organisms, namely reptilian and mammalian organisms. It’s very understandable for people to somewhat sanctify our work or executive brain centers as it’s what makes us so unique, but we need to also be more connected with and appreciative of our primitive brain centers. 
### Thomas Kilmann Conflict Instrument Model
I want to illustrate to you a bit more the dynamics of our primitive brain. You can better understand the dynamics of our love and passion brain centers if we compare it to the Thomas Kilmann Conflict Instrument Model, which is a brilliant model to this more primitive part of ourselves. The Thomas Kilmann Conflict Instrument Model at its core illustrates a graph with two axes. If we look at these axes we see assertiveness and cooperation. 

These tie directly to love and passion. Assertiveness is about our passion, and love is about cooperation. So, we’ve got a very clear parallel and thus a very clear model to use to understand the more primitive parts of our brain. The Thomas Kilmann Conflict Instrument Model was designed to help foster relationships, and the emphasis that they put is that in order to foster relationships, we need to have a balance of being assertive and being compassionate, because we need to be able to express ourselves and what our needs are, and we need to be able to hear what other people’s expressed needs are. So in essence it's very much about needs, both expressing and understanding them. This is also why I think it’s such a beautiful way to understand the more primitive parts of our brain.
### Balancing Drives
Now our work drive is obviously important in the context of work but I want to equally make it appreciated that we have our more primal drives, which unfortunately get ignored too often. And this ignorance can be problematic. Now this is also where I want to try to tie this into autism. People with autism, I believe, as I said, can sometimes manifest their symptoms in being more conflict-driven. And the reason I think this is, is because they struggle to find a balance between their more primal drives and their executive drives, often favoring their primal drives. As people with autism are known to have deficiencies with executive function. Finding this balance is what is needed to better work and relationships. To explore this balance, action needs to be taken not just by the people with autism but also by employers who want to support employees with autism, by incorporating this intent into their managerial styles. The onus is on both the employee and the employer to address their own imbalances. In order for this to happen though both sides need to have a growth mindset. Without a growth mindset people are not going to be able to even consider this article.
### Growth Mindset
I am fortunate enough to have found my way into a journey of growth throughout my life, and I feel like it’s been such a beautiful journey for me, but I want everyone to explore it.I say it’s been a beautiful journey, but it’s also been a painful one. I think everyone has their own relationship with growth. Some are scared of it because of the pain, some embrace it because of the joy.

I think there are a lot of people who are unfortunate enough to not have the kind of relationship with growth that I have, and I understand where they’re coming from. I understand how painful growth can be. I understand how confusing life can be. I understand how you may feel like you’ve reached your peak potential. I also understand that growth in a way never ends, and it can also feel relentless. So sometimes stepping out of that cycle can feel healthy, and this is where I want to inform people that growth does not mean you can;t have comfort. In fact, comfort is one of the important things for growth. But what’s important is to not stagnate in that comfort. It’s about pushing yourself towards something, feeling the discomfort, and then self-soothing. 
### This Article Serves as a Mission Statement
As much as I encourage growth, ultimately, this article also serves as a mission statement for people to understand the mission that I’m on. And my journey with autism and growth. Balancing imbalance is innately part of the journey of having autism and I want to find companies that are also on a growth journey, where the company culture isn't just that of technical growth but personal, emotional and social growth too. 
## Practical Steps
So, how can you help people with autism in the workplace? 
1. Be more considerate of the primal drives that people with autism operate from and their low ability of executive functioning. There are things, accommodations and strategies to manage the executive dysfunction limitations. There’s a plethora of resources online on how to help manage executive function in the workplace for people with autism. 
2. Embrace a more pro-social attitude and culture at work, allowing for expression of emotions, allowing for passion, allowing for comforting, compassion.
3. Understand that professionalism is more than getting tasks done. It’s the ability to work in teams, the development of a team-driven culture, which is where emotional expression and compassion becomes vital
4. And I guess importantly, embracing our primal drives because if they’re suppressed, that doesn’t just hinder the ability for people with autism to work and thrive in workplaces,  it hinders the ability for all people to work and thrive in workplaces.
